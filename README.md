# photo-mosaic
Given a folder with many images and a picture to be overlaid, create a Photo Mosaic

## Demo
**Input - Select Folder with Images**
![Images](/images/Images.JPG)

**Input CANVAS**
![Input Canvas](/images/input_canvas.jpg)

**Stego-image (CRYPTED)** -> The above DATA has been hidden in the above CANVAS
![Crypted](/images/crypted.jpg)

Now, we shall use the above **Stego-image (CRYPTED)**, to extract the original DATA and CANVAS

**Extracted DATA**
