# photo-mosaic
Given a folder with many images and a picture to be overlaid, create a Photo Mosaic

# Steps to Run:
* Run the Matlab Script
* Select the Folder where all the images are
* Select the Image to be Overlaid
* Select the Destination Folder to save the Output Images

# Output:
* Firstly, when the matlab program finishes, it will display three Figures with all the Output Mosaic Options
* Secondly, the chosen 'Mosaic' and 'Mosaic_Bordered' will be saved in the Destination Folder

## Demo
* **Input - Select Folder with IMAGES**
![Input Images](/images/Input_Images.JPG)

* **Input - OVERLAY**
![Input Overlay](/images/Input_Overlay.jpg)

* **Input - Select Destination Folder to save Output**

* **Intermediate - Matlab Figure 1** -> Shows the Final Mosaic & Mosaic_Bordered that are saved
![Matlab Figure 1](/images/Intermediate_fig1.JPG)

* **Intermediate - Matlab Figure 2** -> Shows all the Mosaic & Mosaic_Bordered options
![Matlab Figure 2](/images/Intermediate_fig2.JPG)

* **Intermediate - Matlab Figure 3** -> Shows matlab's builtin fancy merge effects
![Matlab Figure 3](/images/Intermediate_fig3.JPG)

* **Output - Mosaic**
![Mosaic](/images/Output_Mosaic.tiff)

* **Output - Mosaic Bordered**
![Mosaic Bordered](/images/Output_Mosaic_Bordered.tiff)
